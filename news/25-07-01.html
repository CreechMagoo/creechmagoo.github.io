						<h1>DOOM: TGE featuring at Dizzy Spell!</h1>

						<h2>DIZZY SPELL</h2>

						<p>Hi everyone. It's been a while, and we have some very exciting news—DOOM: The Gallery Experience will be featured in Dizzy Spell's "Free Hors d’Oeuvres" exhibition in Denver, CO! The event will be held at <a href="https://www.denvermov.com/exhibitions/event-one-afwzw" title="Rainbow Dome" target="_blank">Rainbow Dome</a>, opening Friday, July 18. You can find out more about the show and all of the other games featured on <a href="https://dizzyspell.xyz/" title="Dizzy Spell" target="_blank">on their website</a>!</p>

						<p>We're super grateful for this opportunity, and never expected our project to balloon into something this significant. We would like to thank the organizers over at Dizzy Spell as well as everyone who has played the game and shared their thoughts and feedback.</p>

						<p>Filippo and I will be attending opening day on July 18th, from 6pm to 9pm. If you happen to be in the area and want to attend, feel free to say hi and enjoy the show!</p>

						<h2>NEW UPDATE SOON</h2>

						<p>We are currently working on making a small update to the game to prepare it for the show, mainly to prepare the game to be available in kiosk mode. This won't be available to the public for the time being, but we plan to release it soon after the exhibition.</p>

						<p>Beyond that, we are also looking into adding in some additional bonus content as a thank you to those who have played the game and continued to keep it relevant. No ETA on this just yet!</p>

						<h2>WHAT'S NEXT</h2>

						<p>We have been prototyping a few of our ideas over the past several months. We're pretty sure we've settled on a good one and are excited to start experimenting with it. You will start hearing more later this year!</p>

						<p>We are also still very dead-set on turning our first jam game, Scummoner, into a proper game. There is no ETA on this, and we're not holding ourselves to a timeframe, but we've worked on a prototype over the past year and are really excited to get back into it.</p>

						<p>Thanks for sticking with SCUM DOG!</p>
